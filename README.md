Excited to share 6th task of my Data Analysis with Python internship at Main Flow Services and Technologies Pvt. Ltd.

In this task i performed some Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Made some questions for Data Visualization from given dataset.
I have choosed 'IPL 2023 Dataset' to perform task 6 

I Have taken 5 Fantastic Question from this dataset to implement its Data Visualization.

Questions :
 "1: Which teams spent the most on player acquisitions?"
 "2: What is the distribution of player types across Each Teams?"
 "3: How much did each team spend on different types of players (Batsman, Bowler, etc.)?",
 "4: Which team got the best value for money considering the type and cost of players?",
